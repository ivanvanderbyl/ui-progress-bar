Pure CSS Progress Bar
=====================

**UPDATE: No longer requires 1 image for stripes.**

Inspired by a shot from [Jonno Riekwel](http://dribbble.com/shots/33322-Modal-upload), I knocked up a quick [Progress Bar](http://dribbble.com/shots/55908-Progress-Bar "Dribbble - Progress Bar by Ivan Vanderbyl") in Photoshop on a friday afternoon before heading to the pub. Then a couple of people suggested implementing it with CSS.

So I did.

Here it is.

Enjoy.
